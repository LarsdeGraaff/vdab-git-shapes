/**
 * Exercise:
 *  - Organize yourselves in teams of two members<br/><br/>
 *  - Start from the same (shared) repository version<br/><br/>
 *  - Team member one:<br/>
 *      * Add a new abstract method "double Shape.area()". Make sure all subclasses implement the contract.<br/>
 *      * Modify Shape.toString() to also print out the area of the shape ("Shape 'Triangle' has an area of 12 square units")<br/><br/>
 *  - Team member two:<br/>
 *      * Add a new abstract method "double Shape.perimeter()". Make sure all subclasses implement the contract.<br/>
 *      * Modify Shape.toString() to also print out the perimeter of the shape ("Shape 'Triangle has a perimeter of 16 units")<br/><br/>
 * - Make sure you commit these changes to the local repository<br/><br/>
 * - Push the changes to the origin<br/>
 *      * Do you encounter any problems? What about your team member?<br/>
 *      * Who was the first to push his/her changes to the origin?<br/>
